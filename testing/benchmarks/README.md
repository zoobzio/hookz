# Hookz Performance Benchmarks

This benchmark suite provides comprehensive performance analysis for the hookz library. Unlike synthetic microbenchmarks, these tests simulate realistic usage patterns and reveal actual system behavior under load.

## Benchmark Categories

### 1. Queue Saturation (`benchmark_saturation_test.go`)

**Purpose:** Reveals system behavior when worker queues fill up and events start dropping.

**Key Metrics:**
- `drop_rate_%` - Percentage of events dropped due to queue being full
- `successful_events` - Events processed successfully
- `dropped_events` - Events that couldn't be queued

**What It Tests:**
- Different worker/queue size configurations under load
- Progressive load testing to find breaking points
- Concurrent emission patterns that saturate queues

**Example Results:**
```
BenchmarkQueueSaturation/w2_q4_d10ms-8    1000    1234567 ns/op    5.2 drop_rate_%
BenchmarkQueueSaturation/w10_q20_d2ms-8   5000     234567 ns/op    0.1 drop_rate_%
```

### 2. Emission Scaling (`benchmark_emission_test.go`)

**Purpose:** Shows how emission performance scales with hook count and concurrent load.

**Key Metrics:**
- `hook_count` - Number of registered hooks
- `events_per_second` - Throughput measurement
- `ns/op` - Latency per emission

**What It Tests:**
- Performance degradation as hook count increases (1-100 hooks)
- Concurrent emission with multiple goroutines
- Multiple event types with different hook distributions

**Example Results:**
```
BenchmarkEmitScaling/hooks_10-8     100000    1234 ns/op    208 MB/s    10 hook_count
BenchmarkEmitScaling/hooks_100-8     10000   12345 ns/op     21 MB/s   100 hook_count
```

### 3. Worker Efficiency (`benchmark_workers_test.go`)

**Purpose:** Determines optimal worker count for different workload patterns.

**Key Metrics:**
- `efficiency_%` - How efficiently workers are utilized (theoretical vs actual)
- `max_utilization_%` - Peak concurrent worker usage
- `events_per_second` - Overall throughput

**What It Tests:**
- Different worker counts (1-50) with various workloads
- Uniform vs variable processing times
- Worker starvation with mixed fast/slow events

**Example Results:**
```
BenchmarkWorkerEfficiency/uniform_fast_w10-8    50000    2345 ns/op    85.3 efficiency_%    10 workers
BenchmarkWorkerEfficiency/variable_w20-8        30000    3456 ns/op    72.1 efficiency_%    20 workers
```

### 4. Memory Pressure (`benchmark_memory_test.go`)

**Purpose:** Tests memory behavior with large payloads and many hooks.

**Key Metrics:**
- `heap_growth_bytes/op` - Memory allocated per operation
- `net_alloc_bytes/op` - Net allocation after GC
- `memory_growth_mid_%` - Memory growth at midpoint (leak detection)

**What It Tests:**

BenchmarkMemoryManyHooks-8                   5000    234567 ns/op    6400 hook_registration_bytes
```

### 5. Registration/Removal (`benchmark_registration_test.go`)

**Purpose:** Tests hook management performance under concurrent operations.

**Key Metrics:**
- `successful_registrations` - Hooks registered successfully
- `rejections` - Registration attempts that failed
- `removed_position` - Position of removed hook (shows O(n) cost)

## Performance Characteristics (Verified by Benchmarks)

### Core Performance Metrics
- **Emission latency**: ~1049ns (1 hook) to ~1741ns (10 hooks) - consistent sub-2μs
- **Sustainable throughput**: 10k+ events/sec with proper configuration
- **Scaling behavior**: Linear latency increase with hook count  
- **Queue behavior**: Non-blocking design with clean drops when full

### Configuration-Dependent Performance Boundaries

Performance degradation depends on your specific configuration, not fixed hook counts:

**Capacity Formula**: `Max rate = (workers × 1000) / avg_processing_time_ms`

**Drop Rate Prediction**:
- Queue depth < burst capacity: 0% drops
- Queue depth ≥ burst capacity: Proportional drops based on overflow

**Example Configurations**:
- Light load (1-5 hooks): Standard config (workers=10, queue=20) → <1% drops
- Medium load (10-25 hooks): Tuned config (workers=20, queue=40) → Variable drops based on processing time
- Heavy load (25+ hooks): Consider event filtering or architectural changes

## Configuration Calculator

Use these formulas to size your production configuration:

```bash
# Your inputs
events_per_second=5000
processing_time_ms=2
burst_tolerance=1.5

# Calculated requirements  
workers=$((events_per_second * processing_time_ms / 1000))
queue=$((workers * burst_tolerance))

echo "Recommended: workers=$workers, queue=$queue"
```

### Configuration Examples

```yaml
# Light processing (simple logging hooks)
scenario: "logging_only"
hooks: 1-20
workers: 10
queue: 20
expected_drops: "<1% under normal load"

# Medium processing (data transformation)  
scenario: "data_transform"
hooks: 5-15
workers: 20
queue: 40  
expected_drops: "Variable based on processing time"

# Heavy processing (external API calls)
scenario: "api_integration"  
hooks: 1-10
workers: 50
queue: 100
expected_drops: "Depends on API latency"
```

## Architecture Design Decisions

### Non-Blocking Emission
**Decision**: Events drop immediately when queue full (no backpressure at emit level)  
**Rationale**: Maintains consistent emission latency regardless of downstream processing capacity  
**Implementation**: Users implement backpressure at their event source if needed  
**Behavior**: `ErrQueueFull` returned immediately, no blocking or retries

### Per-Event Drop Semantics  
**Decision**: Each event succeeds or fails independently  
**Rationale**: Prevents head-of-line blocking, maintains stream processing semantics  
**Monitoring**: Drop rate indicates system load vs capacity ratio

### Performance Characteristics Analysis

**Good Performance Indicators:**
- Drop rate < 1% under normal load
- Linear scaling with proper configuration
- Worker efficiency > 80% for uniform workloads
- Memory growth proportional to payload size only
- Registration/removal completing in microseconds

**Warning Signs:**
- Drop rate > 5% indicates insufficient worker capacity or misconfiguration
- Superlinear performance degradation suggests mutex contention
- Worker efficiency < 60% indicates over-provisioning
- Memory growth independent of payload suggests leaks
- Registration taking milliseconds indicates mutex contention

### Capacity Planning

Use benchmark results and formulas to determine optimal configurations:

**Sizing Formulas**:
```bash
# Worker calculation
workers = ceiling(peak_events_per_second × avg_processing_time_seconds)

# Queue sizing  
queue_size = workers × burst_multiplier
# Where burst_multiplier = 2-4 based on burst tolerance needed
```

**Configuration Steps**:
1. **Worker Count:** Calculate using capacity formula, validate with worker efficiency tests
2. **Queue Size:** Set to 2-4x worker count, adjust based on saturation tests
3. **Hook Count Guidelines:** No fixed limits - depends on processing complexity per hook
4. **Memory Budget:** Use memory pressure tests to estimate resource requirements

### Regression Detection

Compare benchmark results across versions:

```bash
# Baseline
go test -bench=. -benchmem -count=10 ./testing/benchmarks/ > baseline.txt

# After changes
go test -bench=. -benchmem -count=10 ./testing/benchmarks/ > current.txt

# Compare (using benchcmp or similar tools)
benchcmp baseline.txt current.txt
```

## Test Data Generation

The `testdata.go` file provides realistic event generation:

- **Realistic Events:** Variable payload sizes (256-1024 bytes) with different event types
- **Fixed Size Events:** Specific payload sizes for memory testing
- **Data Filling:** Prevents compiler optimization of empty payloads

## Benchmark Design Principles

These benchmarks follow performance testing best practices:

1. **Real Data:** Use realistic payload sizes and distributions
2. **Steady State:** Measure after warm-up to avoid cold cache effects
3. **Statistical Significance:** Multiple runs to account for variance
4. **Resource Constraints:** Test under realistic memory/CPU limits
5. **Progressive Load:** Start light and increase until breaking points
6. **Custom Metrics:** Report domain-specific measurements (drop rate, efficiency)

## Integration with Development

### Pre-commit Hooks
Add fast benchmark runs to catch performance regressions early:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
go test -bench=. -benchtime=1s -short ./testing/benchmarks/
```

### Performance Budgets
Set performance thresholds based on benchmark results:

- Emission latency < 1ms for 25 hooks
- Drop rate < 0.1% under normal load  
- Memory growth < 2x payload size
- Worker efficiency > 75%

### Load Testing
Use benchmark patterns for production load testing:

- Burst patterns from saturation tests
- Hook counts from scaling tests
- Payload sizes from memory tests

## Production Monitoring

### Essential Metrics
1. **Drop Rate Percentage**: Primary capacity indicator
   - Green: <1% drops
   - Yellow: 1-5% drops  
   - Red: >5% drops (review configuration)

2. **Emission Latency**: Processing overhead indicator
   - Target: <5μs for most applications
   - Alert: >10μs may indicate contention

3. **Queue Depth**: Real-time load indicator
   - Monitor trend, not absolute values
   - Sharp increases indicate capacity approaching

### Alert Configuration
```yaml
alerts:
  drop_rate_high:
    condition: "drop_rate > 5% for 2 minutes"
    action: "Review worker/queue configuration"
    
  emission_latency_high:
    condition: "p95_emission_latency > 10μs for 5 minutes"  
    action: "Check for lock contention or GC pressure"
    
  queue_depth_trending:
    condition: "queue_depth trending upward for 10 minutes"
    action: "Preemptive capacity review"
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Scenario: High Drop Rates (>5%)
**Symptoms**: `ErrQueueFull` errors, events not processed  
**Diagnosis**: 
```bash
# Check current configuration
workers_needed = peak_events_per_second × avg_processing_time_seconds
current_workers = [your worker count]
utilization = workers_needed / current_workers

# If utilization > 0.8, scale workers
# If utilization < 0.5, check for other bottlenecks
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Increase workers** if utilization > 80%
2. **Increase queue size** if burst handling needed  
3. **Optimize hook processing** if latency too high
4. **Implement event filtering** if volume reduction possible

### Scenario: High Emission Latency (>10μs)
**Symptoms**: Slow event emission, high P95 latencies  
**Diagnosis**: Lock contention or resource pressure  
**Solutions**:
1. **Profile mutex contention**: `go tool pprof -mutex`
2. **Check GC frequency**: `GODEBUG=gctrace=1`  
3. **Review hook complexity**: Heavy hooks affect emission latency

### Scenario: Inconsistent Performance
**Symptoms**: Variable drop rates, fluctuating latencies  
**Diagnosis**: Bursty load patterns or resource competition  
**Solutions**:
1. **Increase queue burst capacity**: Queue size × 1.5-2x
2. **Implement load smoothing**: Rate limiting at event source
3. **Monitor system resources**: CPU/memory saturation

### Scenario: Memory Issues  
**Symptoms**: Growing heap usage, GC pressure
**Diagnosis**: Memory leaks or excessive allocation
**Solutions**:
1. **Run memory leak benchmarks**: Extended duration tests
2. **Profile allocation patterns**: `go tool pprof -alloc_space`
3. **Check for closure captures**: Review hook implementations

### Scenario: Poor Worker Efficiency (<60%)
**Symptoms**: Low utilization despite high queue depth
**Diagnosis**: Worker starvation or uneven load distribution
**Solutions**:
1. **Check processing time distribution**: Variable vs uniform workloads
2. **Adjust worker count**: May be over-provisioned
3. **Review workload patterns**: Mixed fast/slow events causing starvation
