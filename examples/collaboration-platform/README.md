# Real-time Collaboration Platform - How TeamSync Solved 5-Second UI Freezes

## The Crisis

**Company**: TeamSync (Remote collaboration SaaS)  
**Users**: 50,000 concurrent during peak hours  
**Problem**: Every user action froze the UI for 5+ seconds  
**Impact**: 40% user churn in Q3 2024  

## The Story

TeamSync built a Figma-like collaborative design tool. Multiple users edit the same canvas in real-time. Every action (move, draw, type) needs to:

1. Update the local UI immediately
2. Sync to the server
3. Broadcast to all viewers
4. Update presence indicators
5. Save to history
6. Check permissions
7. Update analytics

The original implementation used synchronous event handlers. One slow operation blocked everything.

### The User Experience Disaster

**Before**: User draws a line → 5 second freeze → Other users see update  
**After**: User draws a line → Instant UI → Background sync → Real-time updates

### The Technical Problem

```go
// THE OLD WAY - Everything blocked
func (c *Canvas) HandleUserAction(action Action) error {
    // Update local state
    c.updateCanvas(action)
    
    // These ALL blocked the UI!
    c.syncToServer(action)           // 500ms API call
    c.broadcastToViewers(action)      // 200ms * viewer count
    c.updatePresence(action.UserID)   // 100ms database
    c.saveHistory(action)             // 300ms write
    c.checkPermissions(action)        // 150ms check
    c.trackAnalytics(action)          // 200ms
    
    return c.renderUI() // Finally update UI after 2+ seconds!
}
```

### The Solution with hookz

```go
func (c *Canvas) HandleUserAction(action Action) error {
    // Update UI immediately
    c.updateCanvas(action)
    c.renderUI()
    
    // Everything else happens in background
    c.hooks.Emit(ctx, "canvas.action", action)
    
    return nil // UI updates instantly!
}
```

## The Implementation Journey

### Week 1: The MVP
"Just get collaboration working" - synchronous everything, works with 2 users

### Week 2: The Scale Test
10 users in a room = 20 second delays. Panic mode activated.

### Week 3: Goroutine Madness
Spawned goroutines everywhere. Memory usage: 8GB for 100 users.

### Week 4: Channel Architecture
Complex channel orchestration. Deadlocks in production.

### Week 5: hookz Implementation
Clean async events. 50ms response times. Happy users.

## Real-World Patterns

### 1. Selective Event Subscription
Not everyone needs every event:
- Viewers only need visual updates
- Editors need full state sync
- Admins need audit events

### 2. Event Prioritization
- User's own actions: Instant local update
- Collaborator actions: 50ms delay acceptable
- Background saves: Best effort

### 3. Presence Management
- Cursor positions update every 100ms
- User status updates every second
- Heartbeat detection for disconnects

### 4. Conflict Resolution
- Operational Transform for text
- Last-write-wins for properties
- Vector clocks for complex state

## Performance Metrics

### Before hookz
- **Action latency**: 2-5 seconds
- **Memory per user**: 80MB (goroutine explosion)
- **Concurrent users**: 100 max
- **User satisfaction**: 2.1/5 stars

### After hookz
- **Action latency**: 50ms average
- **Memory per user**: 2MB stable
- **Concurrent users**: 10,000+
- **User satisfaction**: 4.8/5 stars

## Key Patterns Demonstrated

1. **UI-First Updates**: Never block the UI for backend operations
2. **Selective Broadcast**: Only send relevant events to each user
3. **Presence Tracking**: Efficient heartbeat without flooding
4. **History Buffer**: Async history saves with batching
5. **Permission Caching**: Check permissions async, cache results
6. **Analytics Batching**: Collect events, send in batches

## Production Architecture

```
User Action
    ↓
Local UI Update (instant)
    ↓
hookz.Emit("canvas.action")
    ↓
Parallel Processing:
├── Server Sync (500ms)
├── Viewer Broadcast (200ms)
├── Presence Update (100ms)
├── History Save (300ms)
├── Permission Check (150ms)
└── Analytics Track (200ms)
```

All happen in parallel, none block the UI!

## Lessons Learned

1. **UI responsiveness is everything** - 100ms delay = frustrated user
2. **Not all events are equal** - Prioritize user-facing updates
3. **Selective subscription saves bandwidth** - Don't broadcast everything
4. **Batching is your friend** - Group operations when possible
5. **Memory limits matter** - Goroutines aren't free
